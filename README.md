The client has gathered survey responses from their customers and they want us to help them find the insights on the data collected:

[Data - Data - Survey Monkey Output.xlsx](/Data%20-%20Survey%20Monkey%20Output%20Edited.xlsx).

Ideally the client wants to receive back the data in the format suitable for Power BI, Tableau or any other visualization tool.

The questions to answer:
1. The demographic of the company;
2. How many respondents chose particular answer to a question:
	- How many of them had answered the same reponse;

Such surveys are planned to be implemented on a regular basis so it would be helpful to have some form of automation (scripting).

*Bonus*: Visualizations using a preferred tool that reflect the analysis.
